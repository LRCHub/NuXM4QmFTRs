I've been rejected
Left unprotected
And you might say that I'm a no count
But I'm still growing
And the river's still flowing
Now I know just what it's all about

Ain't well connected
Can't get accepted
That's just another bridge I have to cross
I'm a believer
And faith's the healer
But there's a price to pay, I know the cost

And if it takes a long time, there's no excuse

Just one more heartbreak
Another memory, turn me loose
Just one more heartbreak
You'll have to run to me

The looks of tension
Too cold to mention
Like some muddy boots on someone's polished floor
Ain't broken hearted
Well I've just started
I've got some boots you've never seen before

I can wait, I can dream, forget the bad news

And so we live
Hour by hour fades away
But I know this
I'll make the best of every day
