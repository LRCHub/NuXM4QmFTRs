I hear your voice in my ear
When I'm walking down the street
Those little words whispered so sweet
Comin' in so loud and clear
And I've got to stop, catch my breath
I wanna know just what you said

Tell me just one more time
That you love me
I love to hear you say
Tell me just one more time
That you need me
And that's the way it's gonna stay

Oh, last night was like a dream
And I still ain't woken up yet
I keep on hearing your sweet voice
I remember every word that you said

Tell me just one more time
That you love me
I love to hear you say
Tell me just one more time
That you need me
And that's the way it's gonna stay

It's only words that you say
But you've got me hooked all the same
I've got this feeling way down deep
It's more than words that you're giving to me

Tell me just one more time
That you love me
I love to hear you say
Tell me just one more time
That you need me
And that's the way it's gonna stay

One more time
One more time...
