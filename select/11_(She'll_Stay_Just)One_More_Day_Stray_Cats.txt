My baby she don't tell me anything I don't know
She don't tell me where to go
My baby she don't tell me anything I don't know
She don't tell me where to go
Never tries to tease me, always tries to please me
So she'll stay just one more day

My baby she don't stop when I feel like raisin' hell
She don't put me in a cell
My baby she don't stop when I feel like raisin' hell
She don't put me in a cell
She never gives me bitchin'
Magic in the kitchen
So she'll stay just one more day

My baby always gives me lots of lovin' every night
We never fuss and fight
My baby always gives me lots of lovin' every night
We never fuss and fight
She holds me tight and kiss me
When I'm gone she miss me
So she'll stay just one more day

My baby she don't tell me anything I don't know
She don't tell me where to go
My baby she don't tell me anything I don't know
She don't tell me where to go
Never tries to tease me, always tries to please me
So she'll stay just one more day
So sure can earns her pay
So she'll stay just one more day
