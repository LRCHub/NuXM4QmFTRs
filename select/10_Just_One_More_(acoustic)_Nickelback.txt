Tell me lord where'd my little angel go?
Cause I'm down here alone
If you've got room for just one more
Just one more

All the stars are burning out on me
There's a hotel in the clouds
The sign says no vacancy
From the top of my lungs
I start to scream
From the bottom of my heart
Why aren't you still here with me?

Tell me lord where'd my little angel go?
Cause I'm down here alone
If you've got room for just one more
Just one more

Tell me lord where'd my little angel go?
Cause I'm down here alone
If you've got room for just one more
Just one more
Just one more

Wake me up
Help me understand
Why I'm here all by myself
With these feathers in my hand
If there's a way
To lean a ladder on the moon
I would climb up there tonight
Just so I could be with you

Oh
Tell me lord where'd my little angel go?
Cause I'm down here alone
If you've got room for just one more
Just one more

Tell me lord where'd my little angel go?
Cause I'm down here alone
If you've got room for just one more

Just one more
Just one more
Just one more

Wont stop 'till we're eye to eye
Tell me where to sign on the dotted line
Wont stop 'till we're eye to eye
Even if it means I've got to give my life
Tell me where to sign on the dotted line
Heaven if you hear me give me
Back what's mine

Tell me lord where'd my little angel go?
Cause I'm down here alone
If you've got room for just one more
Just one more

Tell me lord where'd my little angel go?
Cause I'm down here alone
If you've got room for just one more
Just one more

Wont stop 'till we're eye to eye
Even if it means I've got to give my life
(Just one more)
Tell me where to sign on the dotted line
Heaven if you hear me give me
Back what's mine

Just one more
Just one more
